      <h2>Transport</h2>
      <h3>To the Church</h3>
      <p>There will be no available parking space at the church or on the streets around it on the day – however, the
        church is five minutes’ walk from David Lane tram stop.
      <p>There are a number of free tram park-and-ride sites around the city; the closest to the church are Phoenix
        Park, Wilkinson Street, and The Forest. Each is a 10-15 min tram ride from the church, and the trams run
        approximately every 5-10 minutes.
      <ul>
        <li>If using the Phoenix Park park-and-ride, you can buy a “short hop” tram ticket in each direction, and take
          any tram southwards (towards Clifton South or Toton Lane).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>If using The Forest or Wilkinson Street park-and-ride, buy a day ticket, and take any tram northwards
          (towards Phoenix Park or Hucknall).</li>
      </ul>
      (Please note that if parking in the park and ride, you must be using the tram or your car may be clamped. You also
      cannot leave your car parked there overnight.)</p>
      <p>If arriving by train, the trams run from Nottingham station – take any tram northwards (towards Phoenix Park or
        Hucknall).</p>
      <p>Paper tickets can be bought on the ticket machines, or you can tap on with contactless on the card readers on
        the platform. For short hop tickets, you also need to tap off. For more information, see: <u><a
            href="thetram.net" target="_blank">thetram.net</a> </u>
      </p>
      <p>In the very unlikely event that the trams are not running, there are buses which take contactless.
      <ul>
        <li>From Phoenix Park, walk 10 mins to Headstocks pub and get the 71 bus towards the City, to Coriander Drive.
        </li>
        <li>From The Forest, walk 10 mins to Gregory Boulevard and get the 68 or 69 bus towards Bulwell, to Basford
          Crossing.</li>
        <li>From the station: take the 6, 9 or 10 bus to Victoria Centre, then take the 68 or 69 bus from Victoria
          Centre to Basford Crossing.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>To the Reception</h3>
      <p>If you wish to drive to Colwick, there will be parking space available.</p>
      <p>The nearest public transport to Colwick is at the Racecourse. This is a 15 minute walk from Colwick Hall and is
        served by the 44 and 50 buses from the city centre. However, the bus does not run late into the evening.</p>
      <p>If you are taking a taxi from the venue at the end of the evening, booking in advance with a local taxi firm
        may be advisable to ensure availability.</p>
